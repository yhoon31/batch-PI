# Batch Predictive inference

The codes in this repository reproduce the experimental results from _Batch Predictive Inference_.

The functions.R file contains the helper functions necessary to run the procedures and simulations.

simulation.R replicates the experiments from Sections 4.1 and 4.2, while simulation_counterfactual.R reproduces those from Section 4.3.

DTI.R reproduces the experiments from Section 5.
